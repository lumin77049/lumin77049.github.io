# For now, a test site.
While *still* a test site, it's moved from just me messing around with github
pages to something closer to a first iteration of a personal site/blog. I'm not
sure for how long (if at all) I'll maintain the site beyond the setup but it's
a nice first step into personal web-dev. I'd like to look into working with
JavaScript as a part of the site so that might be the next step after styling.

In any case, if somehow you've stumbled across this during your internet
travels, I wish you an enjoyable time poking around and making fun of my
codebase :).
